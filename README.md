# Group Bronzeman Mode RuneLite Plugin

This plugin implements the custom gamemode called 'Group Bronzeman mode', based on Another Bronzeman Mode.

The idea of this gamemode lies somewhere between a 'normal' account and an 'Ironman' account; as you can't buy an item on the Grand Exchange until you have obtained that item through other means, such as getting it as a drop or buying it in a shop.

The plugin enforces this rule by keeping track of all items you acquire, and only allowing you to buy this item.
When the plugin is enabled for the first time it will unlock all items in your inventory, as well as unlock all items in your bank the next time you open it.

## ðŸ†• Group Synchronization

**NEW FEATURE:** Synchronize your unlocks with other players in your group! When any player in your group unlocks an item, everyone in the group can buy it on the Grand Exchange.

**Setup Guide:** See [JSONBIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md](JSONBIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions on setting up group sync with JSONBin.io (free cloud storage).

**How it works:**
- All players share the same JSONBin.io storage (Bin ID)
- Unlocks are automatically synced every few minutes (configurable)
- See who unlocked each item (optional)
- Works offline - syncs when connection is restored

## Features

### Core Features
- Restricts buying items from the Grand Exchange until that item is obtained through self-sufficient methods.
- Will disallow trading players depending on your settings.
- Shows an item unlock graphic every time you obtain an item for the first time.
- Unlocks are handled per account so you can have multiple bronze-men or not effect the status of your bronze-man accounts.
- Can optionally take screenshots of all new item unlocks.
- Supports adding a list of names of other Bronzeman accounts, and will provide them with (client side) Bronzeman chat icons.
- Has settings for sending chat messages and notifications for every item unlock.
- Allows the command '!bmcount' and '!bmunlocks' to get a total number for all unlocked items.

You can see all your unlocks in the Another Bronzeman Mode side-panel as a neatly sortable and filterable list of items.
This interface comes with search functionality, as well as the ability to re-lock an item by right clicking it and selecting "Remove".
