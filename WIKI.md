## What is Group Bronzeman Mode?

Group Bronzeman Mode is a custom game mode that sits between a normal account and an Ironman account. The key rule: **You can't buy an item on the Grand Exchange until you've obtained it through self-sufficient means** (drops, shops, skilling, etc.).

**The "Group" twist:** When playing with friends, all players in your group share the same unlock list! When any player unlocks an item, everyone in the group can buy it on the Grand Exchange.

### Game Mode Philosophy

- üéØ **Encourages exploration** - You must obtain items "the Ironman way" first
- ü§ù **Supports group play** - Share unlocks with your friends
- üìä **Track progress** - See all your unlocked items in a sortable panel
- üîí **Trading restrictions** - Only trade with your group members (optional)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud sync** - Your group's unlocks are automatically synchronized via JSONBin.io

## Group Synchronization Setup

### What You'll Need
- Free JSONBin.io account (10,000 requests/month free)
- Internet connection for syncing
- 5 minutes to set up

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. Create JSONBin.io Account

1. Go to https://jsonbin.io
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Create a free account
4. Verify your email

#### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Log into JSONBin.io
2. Click your profile icon (top-right)
3. Select "API Keys"
4. Copy your **X-Master-Key** (starts with `$2b$...`)
5. Save this somewhere safe - you'll need it

#### 3. Create a Bin (Storage Container)

**Method 1: Via Website (Easiest)**
1. Go to https://jsonbin.io/app/bins
2. Click "Create Bin"
3. Name it something like "OSRS Group Unlocks"
4. In the JSON editor, paste this:
```json
{
  "unlocks": {}
}
```
5. Click "Create"
6. Copy the **Bin ID** (looks like `67a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1`)

**Method 2: Via API (Advanced)**
1. Use the JSONBin API to create a bin programmatically
2. See [JSONBIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md](JSONBIN_SETUP_GUIDE.md) for details

#### 4. Configure Privacy Settings

**IMPORTANT:** Set your bin to private!

1. Open your bin on JSONBin.io
2. Click "Permissions" or "Settings"
3. Set to **"Private"** - Only you (and people with the Bin ID) can access
4. Save changes

#### 5. Configure Plugin

**In RuneLite:**
1. Open Configuration (‚öôÔ∏è)
2. Find "GBM - Group Bronzeman Mode"
3. Scroll to "Group Synchronization" section
4. Fill in:
   - ‚úÖ **Enable group synchronization:** Check this box
   - üìù **JSONBin API Key:** Paste your X-Master-Key
   - üìù **JSONBin Bin ID:** Paste your Bin ID
   - üè∑Ô∏è **Group name:** (Optional) e.g., "Iron Squad"
   - ‚è±Ô∏è **Sync interval:** How often to sync (default: 5 minutes)
   - üë§ **Show who unlocked items:** See attribution (optional)

5. **Save** - The plugin will immediately sync!

#### 6. Share With Your Group

**Give your group members:**
- ‚úÖ The **Bin ID**
- ‚úÖ The **API Key**

**They need to:**
1. Follow steps 1-2 to create their own JSONBin account (optional, for their own keys)
2. OR use your shared API key (easier, but less secure)
3. Configure the plugin with the SAME Bin ID
4. Enable group synchronization

**Security Note:** Anyone with your Bin ID and API key can read/write your group's unlocks. Only share with trusted group members!

### How Syncing Works

#### Automatic Sync
- **Frequency:** Every X minutes (configurable, default 5)
- **What happens:** Plugin fetches new unlocks from JSONBin and merges them into your local list
- **Direction:** Bi-directional (you push your unlocks, you pull others' unlocks)

#### Manual Sync
- **When you unlock an item:** Queued to be pushed on next sync cycle
- **On plugin start:** Immediately syncs from cloud
- **On config change:** Re-initializes sync with new settings

#### Offline Behavior
- **Local unlocks still work** - You don't need internet to play
- **Queued for sync** - Your unlocks are saved locally
- **Automatic catch-up** - When internet returns, syncs automatically

#### Merge Strategy
- **Union merge** - All unlocks from all players are combined
- **No conflicts** - An item is either unlocked or not (no overwriting)
- **Attribution tracking** - Tracks who unlocked each item first (optional display)

### Sync Interval Recommendations

- **1-2 minutes:** Near real-time, uses more API calls
- **5 minutes (default):** Good balance of responsiveness and API usage
- **10-15 minutes:** Conservative, saves API calls
- **30-60 minutes:** Very conservative, suitable for large groups

**API Usage Calculation:**
- Players: 4
- Sync interval: 5 minutes
- Playtime: 3 hours/day average per player
- API calls/day: 4 players √ó (3 hours √ó 60 min / 5 min interval) = ~144 calls/day
- Monthly: ~4,300 calls (well within 10,000 free tier limit)

## Commands

All commands are typed in the in-game chat.

### !bmunlocks (or !bmcount)
**Purpose:** Display your total unlock count

**Usage:**
```
!bmunlocks
```

**Output:**
```
You have unlocked 1,234 items.
```

### !bmbackup
**Purpose:** Create a backup of your unlock list

**Usage:**
```
!bmbackup
```

**Output:**
```
Successfully backed up file!
```

**Location:** Creates a backup file in your RuneLite plugin folder

### !bmreset
**Purpose:** Reset your unlock list (start fresh)

**Requirements:**
- Must enable "Enable reset command" in config first
- Type the command in chat

**Usage:**
```
!bmreset
```

**Output:**
```
Unlocks successfully reset!
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING - RESET WITH GROUP SYNC:**

If you have group synchronization enabled, `!bmreset` has important limitations:

**What happens:**
1. ‚úÖ Your LOCAL unlock list is cleared
2. ‚ùå The JSONBin cloud storage is **NOT** cleared
3. ‚è±Ô∏è On the next sync (within a few minutes), all unlocks will be pulled back from the cloud
4. üîÑ Your unlock list will be restored to match the group's unlocks

**If you want to fully reset the group's unlocks:**
- You must **manually delete the JSONBin** at https://jsonbin.io
- Create a new bin and update all group members with the new Bin ID
- OR manually edit the bin to remove all unlocks using the JSONBin.io web interface

**Recommendation:** Coordinate with your group before resetting unlocks to avoid confusion.

## Advanced Features

### Character Whitelist Details

**Use Case Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Multiple Characters on Jagex Account**
- You have 5 characters on your Jagex account
- Only 2 are bronzemen: "IronMain" and "GroupIM"
- Other 3 are normal accounts or different game modes
- **Solution:** Add "IronMain, GroupIM" to whitelist

**Scenario 2: Testing Without Group Impact**
- You want to test something on an alt
- Don't want test account to add unlocks to your group
- **Solution:** Don't add the alt to the whitelist

**How It Works:**
1. **On Login:** Plugin checks if your character name is on the whitelist
2. **If NOT on whitelist:**
   - Plugin disables itself
   - Chat message: "Plugin disabled for this character (not on whitelist)"
   - No unlocks are tracked
   - No group sync occurs
   - GE restrictions don't apply
3. **If on whitelist:**
   - Plugin works normally
   - All features enabled

**Timing & Retry Logic:**
- Plugin checks whitelist when you log in
- If character name isn't loaded yet, retries after 1 second
- If still not loaded, retries after 4 seconds total
- This handles slow login scenarios

**Mid-Session Changes:**
- Can add/remove characters from whitelist without restarting
- Changes take effect on next login
- If you disable plugin and re-enable mid-session, whitelist check runs again

### Message Queuing System

**Problem Solved:** When you unlock multiple items rapidly (e.g., buying a pack of runes), only the last item would be announced.

**Solution:** Message queuing system

**How It Works:**

**Single Unlock:**
```
You unlock: Fire rune
Chatbox shows: "I unlocked Fire rune for the group!"
Press Enter ‚Üí Sent!
```

**Multiple Unlocks (Before Pressing Enter):**
```
You unlock: Fire rune
Chatbox shows: "I unlocked Fire rune for the group!"

You unlock: Water rune (before pressing Enter)
Chatbox updates: "I unlocked Fire rune, Water rune for the group!"

You unlock: Earth rune (still haven't pressed Enter)
Chatbox updates: "I unlocked Fire rune, Water rune, Earth rune for the group!"

Press Enter ‚Üí All sent in one message!
```

**Smart Queue Management:**
- Automatically detects when you send the message (chatbox becomes empty)
- Clears the queue after sending
- Next unlock starts a fresh batch
- Works with Key Remapping plugin

**Technical Details:**
- Uses `VarClientStr.CHATBOX_TYPED_TEXT` to read/write chatbox content
- Checks if current message contains "I unlocked" to detect pending messages
- If chatbox is empty or has different text, clears old queue

### Trading Restrictions Details

**How It Works:**

**When "Allow trading" is DISABLED (default):**
- You can **only** trade with players in your "Bronzeman Names (Group Members)" list
- All trade attempts with non-group players are blocked
- Two-layer protection system ensures no bypasses

**Protection Layers:**

**Layer 1: Menu Click Blocking**
- Intercepts all trade-related menu options:
  - "Trade with" (right-click player)
  - "Accept trade" (trade requests from others)
  - Any menu option containing "trade"
- Strips color tags from player names for accurate matching
- Compares against your group member list
- If not on list ‚Üí trade attempt is blocked
- Chat message: "You can only trade with your group members: [list]"

**Layer 2: Trade Screen Validation** (Currently disabled to prevent script errors)
- Previously detected trade screen opening
- Would auto-close if partner not on list
- Removed due to script compatibility issues
- Layer 1 is sufficient for blocking all trades

**Dynamic Updates:**
- Add/remove players from group list mid-session
- Changes take effect immediately (no restart needed)
- Tested scenarios:
  - ‚úÖ Add player ‚Üí Can trade immediately
  - ‚úÖ Remove player ‚Üí Trade blocked immediately
  - ‚úÖ Re-add player ‚Üí Can trade again

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Color-coded names (rank indicators, etc.)
- Level indicators in player names
- Special characters
- Case-insensitive matching

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Showing Up in RuneLite

**Symptoms:** Can't find "GBM - Group Bronzeman Mode" in Plugin Hub

**Solutions:**

1. **Check JAR Location**
   - Verify `group-bronzeman-mode-1.2.jar` is in `.runelite\sideloaded-plugins\`
   - Check file size (should be 50-60KB)

2. **Check JAR Contents**
   - Open JAR like a ZIP file
   - Verify `runelite-plugin.properties` exists at root level
   - If missing, rebuild with latest code

3. **Try Developer Mode**
   - Close RuneLite
   - Open Command Prompt
   - Navigate to RuneLite folder
   - Run: `RuneLite.exe --developer-mode`

4. **Check for Name Conflicts**
   - Disable any other "Group Bronzeman Mode" plugins

5. **Clear RuneLite Cache**
   - Close RuneLite
   - Delete `.runelite\cache\` folder
   - Restart RuneLite

### Whitelist Not Working

**Symptoms:** Character on whitelist shows "not on whitelist" message

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Character Name Spelling**
   - Names are case-sensitive
   - Check for extra spaces
   - Format: `Character1, Character2, Character3`

2. **Wait for Name to Load**
   - Plugin retries after 1 second, then 4 seconds
   - If you see warning in logs, wait a few seconds

3. **Check Logs**
   - Look for: `"Character 'YourName' is on whitelist. Plugin enabled."`
   - Or: `"Character 'YourName' not on whitelist. Plugin disabled."`

4. **Try Re-logging**
   - Log out and back in
   - Whitelist check runs on every login

### Group Sync Not Working

**Symptoms:** Unlocks not syncing with group

**Common Issues:**

**1. Invalid Credentials**
- **Check:** API Key starts with `$2b$`
- **Check:** Bin ID is the correct format (alphanumeric)
- **Test:** Visit https://jsonbin.io and log in to verify account

**2. Network Issues**
- **Check:** Internet connection working
- **Check:** Firewall not blocking JSONBin.io
- **Test:** Visit https://jsonbin.io in browser

2. **Check Group Members List**
   - Verify player name is spelled correctly
   - Format: `Player1, Player2, Player3`
   - Case-insensitive matching

3. **Update Group List Mid-Session**
   - Add player to list
   - No restart needed
   - Changes apply immediately

4. **Check Logs**
   - Look for: `"Trade attempt with: 'PlayerName'"`
   - Look for: `"Comparing 'PlayerName' with group member 'X'"`
   - Should show: `"Allowing trade with group member"` or `"Blocking trade"`
